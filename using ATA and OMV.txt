Yes, both should work simultaneously. They use different paths:

  ATA traffic:
  - ATA (192.168.9.217) → br-lan → tailscale0 → main Brume → PBX

  OMV access (via jump host):
  - Your Mac → Tailscale → gl-mt2500-d (100.76.158.115) → eth0 → OMV (192.168.1.231)

  The SSH jump host method from the JSON file doesn't interfere with the ATA routing because:
  - OMV is on the eth0 side (192.168.1.x local network at that site)
  - ATA is on the br-lan side (192.168.9.x)

  To access OMV, use the same method from before:

  # SSH jump through the Brume
  ssh -J root@100.76.158.115 YOUR_OMV_USER@192.168.1.231

  # Or for SMB tunnel
  ssh -L 1445:192.168.1.231:445 root@100.76.158.115
  # Then connect to smb://localhost:1445

  Both should work at the same time without conflict.
